            <i>A rose by any other name wouldn’t smell as wild yet pristine.</i><br />
            Behind Tom Ford’s Los Angeles home lies the only part of the property that the avowed
            Virgo allowed his husband, Richard Buckley, control of – the rose garden that inspired
            TOM FORD’s Rose Prick eau de parfum. Different varietals including Turkish and Bulgarian
            roses and Rose de Mai bloom alongside one another in an organic way that defies the
            designer’s symmetry-bound nature, while Sichuan pepper and turmeric act as the thorns,
            binding them together in interlocked perfection.

            <i>All the epicurean excellence you’ve come to expect from the Harrods name.</i><br />
            The Harrodian − our namesake hamper – is what dreams are made of. Its three wicker
            baskets are brimming with crowd-pleasing delights; opening each one is like strolling
            through our iconic Food Halls. Chocolates plucked from our gleaming display cases,
            charcuterie and cheeses passed on from our specialists with a smile, teas, jams and
            biscuits selected from their seemingly endless shelves, and, of course, several lovely
            vintages to tie the luxurious Harrods experience together.

            ><br />
            Frédéric Malle called the Portrait Of A Lady “one of the finest things we’ve ever made”.
            The pure perfume is endlessly sensual, a sublime marriage of elegance and the
            spectacular like a grand opera. It transforms the fresh, spicy base of the Maison’s
            Geranium Pour Monsieur with an enormous burst of rose to create a scent that empowers a
            woman with its modern, resonant voice.

            Lying in the foothills of the Helderberg Mountains, the Morgenster Estate is home to a
            grove of Italian olive trees that were first planted by founder Giulio Bertrand – also
            known as the Grandfather of Olive Oil. Continuing the vision and expertise of its
            founder, the Estate produces the purest, unadulterated extra virgin olive oil, cold
            pressed and bottled on site. Fresh and grassy, it silkily rolls over the tongue with
            notes of walnut skins and ripening tomatoes. Pleasant bitterness and peppery rocket hit
            at the back of the throat as you swallow – characteristics indicative of top-quality
            oils.

            <i>The tonal iteration of the paisley pattern adds intrigue to the simple piece.</i

            Paisley is the vibrant, flourishing lifeblood of Etro – a signature pattern that has
            sustained the label as an unending font of inspiration. This classic cotton shirt acts
            as an endlessly wearable canvas for an elegant, tonal iteration of the iconic motif,
            while fine Italian craftsmanship affirms its exceptional status.

            Floral Street fragrances are inspired by the vibrant city streets of London, stepping
            away from the formal French bouquet approach to crafting scents to mirror the lively and
            diverse brown-paper-wrapped bunches of British flower markets. Each represents a
            different mood, feeling or woman; the Black Lotus eau de parfum is an English rose
            wearing a biker jacket. It’s complex and multifaceted, rebellious and intoxicating – its
            honied heart of centifolia rose is enveloped in powerful and luscious notes of black
            cherry, saffron and leather. Just a brush with it leaves a life-long impression.

                Imagine a cool breeze rolling through an open window, cotton curtains billowing with

                breathe a sigh of relief that you don't have to actually live in the country to
                enjoy all the charm of an airy farmhouse.

            Since 1643, Cire Trudon has illuminated and scented the finest rooms in the world with
            its candles, channelling centuries of expertise into thoughtfully curating every element
            of its offerings, from wax to wick. The Cyrnos candle is inspired by the eponymous villa
            of Empress Eugénie circa 1894; perched upon Cap Martin on the Côte d’Azur, the retreat
            had a magnificent garden where the aristocracy, artists and intellectuals would
            congregate in the shade of fig trees and parasol pines as they looked out onto the
            crystalline Mediterranean. This scent evokes that atmosphere for your own auspicious
            guests.

            Bibi Van Der Velden’s fascination with the beauty and movements of the cosmos plays out
            superbly across the Galaxy Collection. Suspended from a delicate chain, a central planet
            carved from 60,000-year-old mammoth tusk is orbited by a pair of yellow gold rings as
            diamonds, sapphires and opals soar across its sky and crash into its surface, landing in
            constellation patterns. This necklace’s pendant spins within itself to parallel the
            timeless flow and drive of the universe and create an endlessly tactile and playful
            experience.

            Capturing the brand's luxurious fragrance of the same name, the Mugler Cuir Impertinent
            candle exemplifies the Les Exceptions collection's philosophy of clashing the finest
            materials to create an unexpected and elevated olfactory experience. The smokiness of
            tanned leather hangs in the air, ruggedly masculine, when star anise appears with its
            aromatic freshness breaking through like a window thrown open to brilliant sunlight. The
            result is an obsession-worthy and seductive scent that you'll burn for all 40 hours.

            Hermandad Blend 2016 is the result of the harmonious orchestration of different grape
            varieties. Each chimes in, weaving the notes, aromas and flavours characteristic of
            their native terroirs. The Malbec intones sweetness and the volume of the mouth, singing
            aromas of blackberries, plum, cassis and sweet velvety tannins.

            Evocative of the spiral movement a viper makes before it strikes, the Bulgari Serpenti
            rose gold bracelet mesmerizes with its enveloping curves. Coiling sensually around the
            wrist, the design alternates between malachite inlay and pavé diamond scales to
            illustrate the duality of the snake’s nature between light and shadow, danger and
            desire.

            Graceful and striking, D.S. & Durga’s White Peacock Lily eau de parfum makes a unique
            and memorable signature. Tail feathers shudder with ambrette seed, vanilla and fog,
            then, slowly rising with lily, jasmine and violet to stand at breath-taking attention
            alongside oleander, rouge and grapefruit.

            candle exemplifies the Les Exceptions collection’s philosophy of clashing the finest

            green basil starts the journey with a powerful thrust forward, while cream sandalwood
            and vanilla meander through the scent-scape as a thrum of carrot seed rumbles
            underneath.

            feeling of time standing still.

            The presents have long been torn open, the turkey devoured and the crackers pulled – now
            it’s time to settle down by the fire with a cup of our After-Dinner Christmas Coffee.
            Offering as comforting an embrace as the yule log’s flames, this full-bodied cup is rich
            with nutty and sweet notes thanks to the way its Arabica beans are cultivated; Yellow
            Bourbon cherries are handpicked on the Fazenda Pantano estate and then dried evenly
            along raised beds.

            Carine Roitfeld’s 7 Lovers collection is an homage to the former editor-in-chief of
            Vogue Paris’ unforgettable inamoratos in seven iconic cities around the world, the
            amorous conquests of her insatiable hunger for romance and passion. The Aurèlien eau de
            parfum is inspired by her first great love in Paris; it takes on an opposites-attract
            narrative with its elegant yet sensual combination of jasmine and orange blossom with
            davana, musk and resins.

            Crafted for the free spirits of Marfa, Texas, D.S. & Durga’s El Cosmico eau de parfum is
            an exodus from the world of urgency like the bohemian oasis for which it’s named. The
            scents of shrubs, pepper and pinyon pine rise on the desert air, while stale gasoline
            radiates off an abandoned highway, grounded in an expanse of sand.
