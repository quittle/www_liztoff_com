        If there is one thing that I&rsquo;ve learned in my copywriting career, it is that
        creativity is a muscle, not a specific skill set, and an adept copywriter can flex their
        creativity to seamlessly meet the needs of a brand, client, or project.

        I have had the pleasure of writing about the everyday brands of American flash-sale retailer
        Zulily, the luxury brands of the iconic London department store Harrods and everything in
        between. Then, in search of a new challenge outside of the world of fashion and e-commerce,
        I became the sole creative writer for the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA).

        No matter my prior experience with the subject matter, I have found a way to create engaging
        experiences for audiences with a wide variety of interests and backgrounds.
