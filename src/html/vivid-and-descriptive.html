        <i>A rose by any other name wouldn’t smell as wild yet pristine.</i><br />
        Behind Tom Ford’s Los Angeles home lies the only part of the property that the avowed Virgo
        allowed his husband, Richard Buckley, control of – the rose garden that inspired TOM FORD’s
        Rose Prick eau de parfum. Different varietals including Turkish and Bulgarian roses and Rose
        de Mai bloom alongside one another in an organic way that defies the designer’s
        symmetry-bound nature, while Sichuan pepper and turmeric act as the thorns, binding them
        together in interlocked perfection.

        <i>All the epicurean excellence you’ve come to expect from the Harrods name.</i><br />
        The Harrodian − our namesake hamper – is what dreams are made of. Its three wicker baskets
        are brimming with crowd-pleasing delights; opening each one is like strolling through our
        iconic Food Halls. Chocolates plucked from our gleaming display cases, charcuterie and
        cheeses passed on from our specialists with a smile, teas, jams and biscuits selected from
        their seemingly endless shelves, and, of course, several lovely vintages to tie the
        luxurious Harrods experience together.

            would be a Renoir nude.”</i
        ><br />
        Frédéric Malle called the Portrait Of A Lady “one of the finest things we’ve ever made”. The
        pure perfume is endlessly sensual, a sublime marriage of elegance and the spectacular like a
        grand opera. It transforms the fresh, spicy base of the Maison’s Geranium Pour Monsieur with
        an enormous burst of rose to create a scent that empowers a woman with its modern, resonant
        voice.

        Lying in the foothills of the Helderberg Mountains, the Morgenster Estate is home to a grove
        of Italian olive trees that were first planted by founder Giulio Bertrand – also known as
        the Grandfather of Olive Oil. Continuing the vision and expertise of its founder, the Estate
        produces the purest, unadulterated extra virgin olive oil, cold pressed and bottled on site.
        Fresh and grassy, it silkily rolls over the tongue with notes of walnut skins and ripening
        tomatoes. Pleasant bitterness and peppery rocket hit at the back of the throat as you
        swallow – characteristics indicative of top-quality oils.

        <i>The tonal iteration of the paisley pattern adds intrigue to the simple piece.</i><br />
        Paisley is the vibrant, flourishing lifeblood of Etro – a signature pattern that has
        sustained the label as an unending font of inspiration. This classic cotton shirt acts as an
        endlessly wearable canvas for an elegant, tonal iteration of the iconic motif, while fine
        Italian craftsmanship affirms its exceptional status.

        Floral Street fragrances are inspired by the vibrant city streets of London, stepping away
        from the formal French bouquet approach to crafting scents to mirror the lively and diverse
        brown-paper-wrapped bunches of British flower markets. Each represents a different mood,
        feeling or woman; the Black Lotus eau de parfum is an English rose wearing a biker jacket.
        It’s complex and multifaceted, rebellious and intoxicating – its honied heart of centifolia
        rose is enveloped in powerful and luscious notes of black cherry, saffron and leather. Just
        a brush with it leaves a life-long impression.

            Imagine a cool breeze rolling through an open window, cotton curtains billowing with it.
            The sound of birds chirping outside greets you as you walk through your home and breathe
            a sigh of relief that you don't have to actually live in the country to enjoy all the
            charm of an airy farmhouse.

        Since 1643, Cire Trudon has illuminated and scented the finest rooms in the world with its
        candles, channelling centuries of expertise into thoughtfully curating every element of its
        offerings, from wax to wick. The Cyrnos candle is inspired by the eponymous villa of Empress
        Eugénie circa 1894; perched upon Cap Martin on the Côte d’Azur, the retreat had a
        magnificent garden where the aristocracy, artists and intellectuals would congregate in the
        shade of fig trees and parasol pines as they looked out onto the crystalline Mediterranean.
        This scent evokes that atmosphere for your own auspicious guests.

        Bibi Van Der Velden’s fascination with the beauty and movements of the cosmos plays out
        superbly across the Galaxy Collection. Suspended from a delicate chain, a central planet
        carved from 60,000-year-old mammoth tusk is orbited by a pair of yellow gold rings as
        diamonds, sapphires and opals soar across its sky and crash into its surface, landing in
        constellation patterns. This necklace’s pendant spins within itself to parallel the timeless
        flow and drive of the universe and create an endlessly tactile and playful experience.

        Capturing the brand's luxurious fragrance of the same name, the Mugler Cuir Impertinent
        candle exemplifies the Les Exceptions collection's philosophy of clashing the finest
        materials to create an unexpected and elevated olfactory experience. The smokiness of tanned
        leather hangs in the air, ruggedly masculine, when star anise appears with its aromatic
        freshness breaking through like a window thrown open to brilliant sunlight. The result is an
        obsession-worthy and seductive scent that you'll burn for all 40 hours.

        Hermandad Blend 2016 is the result of the harmonious orchestration of different grape
        varieties. Each chimes in, weaving the notes, aromas and flavours characteristic of their
        native terroirs. The Malbec intones sweetness and the volume of the mouth, singing aromas of
        blackberries, plum, cassis and sweet velvety tannins.

        Evocative of the spiral movement a viper makes before it strikes, the Bulgari Serpenti rose
        gold bracelet mesmerizes with its enveloping curves. Coiling sensually around the wrist, the
        design alternates between malachite inlay and pavé diamond scales to illustrate the duality
        of the snake’s nature between light and shadow, danger and desire.

        Graceful and striking, D.S. & Durga’s White Peacock Lily eau de parfum makes a unique and

        rising with lily, jasmine and violet to stand at breath-taking attention alongside oleander,
        rouge and grapefruit.

        The presents have long been torn open, the turkey devoured and the crackers pulled – now
        it’s time to settle down by the fire with a cup of our After-Dinner Christmas Coffee.
        Offering as comforting an embrace as the yule log’s flames, this full-bodied cup is rich
        with nutty and sweet notes thanks to the way its Arabica beans are cultivated; Yellow
        Bourbon cherries are handpicked on the Fazenda Pantano estate and then dried evenly along
        raised beds.

        Carine Roitfeld’s 7 Lovers collection is an homage to the former editor-in-chief of Vogue
        Paris’ unforgettable inamoratos in seven iconic cities around the world, the amorous
        conquests of her insatiable hunger for romance and passion. The Aurèlien eau de parfum is
        inspired by her first great love in Paris; it takes on an opposites-attract narrative with
        its elegant yet sensual combination of jasmine and orange blossom with davana, musk and
        resins.

        Crafted for the free spirits of Marfa, Texas, D.S. & Durga’s El Cosmico eau de parfum is an
        exodus from the world of urgency like the bohemian oasis for which it’s named. The scents of
        shrubs, pepper and pinyon pine rise on the desert air, while stale gasoline radiates off an
        abandoned highway, grounded in an expanse of sand.
