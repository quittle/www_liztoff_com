        I’ve been fortunate in my career to work alongside some amazing people who have graciously
        said the following about me.

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Thank you so much for everything you’ve brought to the team – for all of your
                    hard work, and for always being transparent about what we can do better to
                    support the team. I have always really appreciated all of your input, and I know
                    I don’t just speak for myself – not only because I’ve read all of your [Studio
                    Employee of the Month] nominations when they’ve come through.
                </p>

                    Liz’s copy is always really smooth and easy to read, which is something I think
                    her juniors massively benefit from when it comes to her own subbing. It’s partly
                    because her grammar is perfect, but also because she has that more poetic
                    approach, which I love! Her copy is so richly descriptive and she really fine
                    tunes how the description feels as a whole.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love her writing, and her style and tone are spot on to me always. Fragrances
                    and fine jewellery are where she really shines and I think her storytelling in
                    these categories is absolutely her strength. The fact that her creativity levels
                    stayed up through [the stressful, high-volume time of COVID] is a real
                    achievement, to be quite honest, given the pressures and the state of the world!

                <h3>Elle Hyde Harting</h3>
                <div>
                    Elle Harting managed Liz directly as Editorial Copy Supervisor at Zulily
                </div>

                    It is with pure pleasure to be able to recommend Elizabeth Toff for any creative
                    adventure in writing or otherwise that she deems worthy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having the uncommon penchant for total brand immersion, Elizabeth not only
                    perfected the brand voice through her writing, she embodied and lived it. Not
                    unlike a method actor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The professional obstacles she chose to work through for her development
                    outshined her peers with the same tenure. I seized the opportunity to recognize
                    Elizabeth on multiple occasions for the growth she exhibited in the time on my
                    team. Most notably, I honored her with a Quarterly Award which recognized her
                    team leadership and influencer soft-skills, productivity and measured growth in
                    personal goals/deliverables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On top of all the professional ways I got to see Elizabeth thrive in her role,
                    she was such a delight to work with. She tells it like it is, has a witty sense
                    of humor, (undoubtably linked to her intelligence), and is always willing to
                    show her team the ropes. She does this all while over-performing in both
                    production and quality.
                </p>
                <p>Any team with her on it would no doubt be better for it.</p>

                <h3>Kayla Lujan</h3>
                <div>
                    Kayla managed Liz directly as Editorial Copy Supervisor and Editorial Copy Lead
                    at Zulily
                </div>

                    There are not enough positive adjectives that aptly summarize just how wonderful
                    Liz Toff is as a human, but especially as an employee.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had the pleasure of overseeing Liz during a portion of her time at zulily, a
                    break-neck-speed, high-volume e-commerce company. When Liz initially joined our
                    team as a coordinator, she was eager to excel and took the nebulous aspects of
                    the role on with vigor. That energy carried through and she quickly became the
                    backbone of the team, providing solutions and ideas to process improvement at
                    every turn. As fate would have it, Liz also happened to be one of the most
                    naturally gifted writers I’ve ever met. She expressed interest in moving her
                    career in the copywriting direction and despite a lack of formal training,
                    sought out every opportunity to hone in on her craft and refine her writing
                    style. When the time came to grow the team, it was a no-brainer, Liz was the
                    obvious choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a copywriter, Liz was an absolute bar-raiser. She continuously pushed herself
                    for better results and consistently sought out feedback to improve. Her
                    seemingly endless creativity inspired the direct team regularly. As if the
                    technical skills weren’t enough, Liz is also a diplomatic communicator and was
                    able to build relationships with just about anybody.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In summary, having Liz on my team was a complete joy. Not just for her afore
                    mentioned talents, but for her humor, kind heart, positivity and warmth. She was
                    a joy to manage, a joy to lead and a joy to work beside. Any team would benefit
                    greatly to have her on it.

                <h3>Kendall Pepple</h3>
                <div>Liz worked with Kendall, Editorial Copy Editor at Zulily</div>

            <div>
                <p>
                    Friendly, thoughtful, extremely curious and creative—Liz always works hard with
                    the added benefit of having a truly unique personality. At zulily, I had the
                    pleasure of training her as my replacement for the Editorial Studio Coordinator
                    position and worked alongside her as an editor and writer when she began writing
                    for editorial. Having been in both positions before her, I can say with
                    certainty that Liz has the ability to take on a great range of tasks and do each
                    well. Not only that, she always adds her own original, creative spin at every
                    turn. I highly recommend Liz for any team seeking a productive, inventive
                    individual.

                <h3>Ashley Kim</h3>
                <div>Liz worked with Ashley as an Editorial Copywriter at Zulily</div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    I had the pleasure of working alongside Liz when she was a coordinator and
                    editorial copywriter at zulily. Liz’s creativity is top-notch — you can always
                    count on her copy to surprise and delight — and her quick wit is a huge asset to
                    group brainstorms. She has a propensity for leadership and puts it to good use
                    whether it’s creating a presentation to encourage copy freshness or training new
                    team members. Liz is bright, bubbly and energizes every meeting. I’d jump at the
                    chance to work with her again!
