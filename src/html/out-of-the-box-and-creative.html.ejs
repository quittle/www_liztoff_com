            ><br />
            In the world of Maria Tash, diamonds defy gravity, and the rose gold Floating Pear Charm
            threaded stud single earring is the perfect example of this as it showcases just how the
            jewellery designer manages to create this sought-after illusion. Some would say magic,
            others would say it’s a discrete jump ring mechanism that grants the stone subtle
            movement, allowing it to catch the light and reveal the diamond’s brilliant pear shape.

            As darkness falls around them, the audience sits in anticipation; sandalwood, cashmere,
            amber, and incense weaving together to tell the past and present of the historic theatre
            around them. The velvety curtain is thrown wide open with a symphony of orange, magnolia
            and fig leaves as Indian jasmine, ylang-ylang, cinnamon and Bulgarian rose burst onto
            the stage from the wings to present the Xerjoff Ouverture eau de parfum.

            <i>A scent as enchanting as the bottle that it’s presented in.</i><br />
            Curtains rise as the Xerjoff Opera eau de parfum begins with an overture of plucky fruit
            notes and nutmeg. Ylang-ylang, leather and amber burst forth like a moving
            orchestra-backed aria as a spotlight of patchouli, vanilla, vetiver and musk cast a warm
            glow across the rose-scattered cedarwood stage.

            Carine Roitfeld’s 7 Lovers collection is an homage to the former editor-in-chief of
            Vogue Paris’ unforgettable inamoratos in iconic cities around the world, the conquests
            of her insatiable hunger for romance and passion. The Vladimir eau de parfum is inspired
            by her Slavic roots and St. Petersburg; two lovers stealing away into the wings of The
            Mariinsky Theatre, bright grapefruit and bergamot are enveloped by aromatic sage and
            heady incense, as frankincense contrasts against amber to express rigour and fluidity
            like dancers warming up to Tchaikovsky on the main stage.

            A knight approached, ready to vanquish the beast and save the princess, but stopped in
            his tracks when he saw the sweet, gentle expression of Jellycat’s Bashful Dragon. Not a
            fiery foe but a friend indeed, the ultra-soft plush with its suede-like wings and petite
            horns is a delightfully tactile guardian for your own magical playroom.

            <i>This cotton summer dress is as flattering as it is feminine.</i><br />
            Inspired by the prospect of Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s upcoming project – the new Bond film
            – creative director Ian Griffiths asked himself: “Why not do a wardrobe for a film that
            hasn’t been made?” And so, the Spring/Summer 2020 collection becomes an ode to the
            heroine we all aspire to be. With flattering silhouettes like this one, the Italian
            label creates an inspirational narrative that recasts the Max Mara woman as the
            protagonist. However, it wouldn’t be complete without feminine details, which is why
            this dress is finished with a delicate Broderie Anglaise pattern.

            Louis Cartier introduced the Panthère in 1914, but Jeanne Toussaint – Cartier’s Artistic
            Director from 1933 to 1970 – elevated it to the fierce fashion icon it is today.
            Depending on how light glances off the lavish constellation of 242 brilliant-cut
            diamonds, piercing emerald eyes and onyx markings, the panther appears predatory,
            playful or languid, revealing a multifaceted personality to this yellow gold ring.

            trends, while holding dear the tenets of classic tailoring. Showcasing a speckled weave,
            this piece exemplifies its Napoli roots with irreverent elegance.

            Standing atop the cliffs of the Amalfi coast, the Xerjoff Verde Accento eau de parfum
            villa is surrounded by a cascading orchard of Italian mandarin and bergamot from Reggio
            Calabria. The fresh morning breeze carries notes of amber, sandalwood and musk from the
            turquoise waters below, picking up iris, jasmine and pink pepper as it winds its way
            through the cobbled market streets.

            1891, D.S. &amp; Durga Burning Barbershop eau de parfum weaves a sultry and exciting
            scent story. Spearmint, and lime spark across hemlock spruce at the top, building to
            hearty notes of lavender absolute and Turkish rose and finally giving way to flames of
            burnt oil, vanilla and hay.

            sprouts up along the horizon, silhouetted by the light of the setting sun as the faint
            sound of a crooner’s love song plays across the salty summer breeze. That is the
            experience of D.S. &amp; Durga’s Rose Atlantic eau de parfum.

            cardamom and green mandarin echo like a horn throughout the primeval forest as a horde
            tramples geranium, European larch and Templin cones.

            An irresistible fragrance that Annick Goutal created for her daughter Camille as a gift,

            carefree pear and peach, the fragrance unveils captivating and devilishly charming notes
            of velvety musky rose and freshly-cut grass. A base of sweet vanilla finishes off the
            scent meant to be evocative of a bestowing a sweet kiss on a young girl’s cheek.

            lit by the glowing benzoin cityscape as comforting aromas of warm vanilla and tonka bean
            leak out of patisseries, promising that this is a night you’ll never forget.

            The YSL woman is fierce, bold, authentic and, above all else, free; this is the

            fragrance is inspired by vegetal poisons, enticing you to keep returning to its fresh
            aura while something deep inside warns you to steer clear. Green mandarin and crisp
            angelica shimmer across the top in a mesmerising veil, while iris blooms at its heart
            and vetiver and patchouli seal its lethal spell.
