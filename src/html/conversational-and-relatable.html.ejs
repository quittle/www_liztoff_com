            Minimalist Scandinavian design meets new-parent practicality in the SnüzKot from Snüz,
            with a sleek frame that transforms and grows with your little one. Set the mattress at
            the highest position to easily reach newborns and progressively move it to the two lower
            positions to keep mischievous toddlers in bed at night. As they get older, the safety
            railings can be removed from the ombré beechwood design, converting to a bed for
            children up to four years old.

            When its founders couldn’t find fine collars with the vet-recommended breakaway safety
            catch, Cheshire & Wain stepped up to the challenge, creating beautiful cat collars like
            this one with their welfare in mind. Caviar is the London brand’s most luxurious
            collection to date; it melds leather, suede and solid brass hardware and embosses it
            with a grained texture to mirror its gourmet namesake. As a final playful flourish, it
            is presented in a novelty tin that can be later used to stash treats.
